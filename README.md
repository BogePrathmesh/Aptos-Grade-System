📚 Grade Blockchain System
🔹 Overview

The Grade Blockchain System is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Aptos Blockchain. It solves the problems of traditional grading systems by ensuring security, transparency, and authenticity of student marks.

Teachers can add or update student grades, while students can only view their records. All data is stored on-chain, making it tamper-proof and fully verifiable.

🔹 Features

🧑‍🏫 Role-based access – Teachers can manage grades, students can only view.

🔒 Secure & Transparent – Blockchain ensures no grade tampering or loss.

⚡ Fast & Reliable – Built on Aptos Move smart contracts for efficiency.

🌐 User-friendly Frontend – React-based interface for easy interaction.

📖 Immutable Records – Once stored, data cannot be changed or deleted.

🔹 Tech Stack
